# Tic Tac Toe

Welcome!

This is a simple Tic Tac Toe game app written in Swift 3 with both single player and multi-player modes. 

In order to run this app, you will need Xcode 8.2.1. Feel free to fork this repo and then clone locally in your terminal.
Next, just open up the project and hit command run. Your simulator should appear on your screen and you should see a blue screen with green buttons.

If you have any questions, feel free to message me.


Note: I will continue to make updates to this app and in the future, will also work on making the single player mode more diffult.
